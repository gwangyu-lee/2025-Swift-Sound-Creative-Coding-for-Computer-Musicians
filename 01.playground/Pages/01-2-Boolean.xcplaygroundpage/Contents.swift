 # Boolean
 Swift has a basic Boolean type, called Bool. Boolean values are referred to as logical, because they can only ever be true or false. Swift provides two Boolean constant values, true and false:

 ```
 let iLoveMarte = true
 let iLoveMaxMsp = false
 ```
 */

let iLoveMarte: Bool = true
let iLoveMaxMsp: Bool = false

//: [Next](@next)
