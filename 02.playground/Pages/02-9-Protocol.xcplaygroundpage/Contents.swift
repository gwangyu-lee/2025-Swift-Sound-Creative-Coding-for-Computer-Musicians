 # Protocol
 
 A `protocol` defines a **blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements** that suit a particular task or piece of functionality.
 
 Classes, structs, or enums can then **adopt** and **conform to** the protocol by implementing those requirements.
 
 Protocols help define **shared behavior** in a clean and consistent way.
 
 ## Syntax
 ```
 protocol NAME {
     STATEMENTS
 }
 ```
