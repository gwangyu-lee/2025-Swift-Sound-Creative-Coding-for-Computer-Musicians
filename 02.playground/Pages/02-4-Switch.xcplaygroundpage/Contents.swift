 # Switch
 A switch statement considers a value and compares it against several possible matching patterns. It then executes an appropriate block of code, based on the first pattern that matches successfully. A switch statement provides an alternative to the if statement for responding to multiple potential states.
 
 ## Syntax
 ```
 switch SOME VALUE TO CONSIDER {
 case VALUE1:
    REPOND TO VALUE1
 case VALUE2:
    REPOND TO VALUE2
 case VALUE3, VALUE4:
    REPOND TO VALUE3 or 4
 default:
    OTHERWISE, DO SOMETHING ELSE
 }
 ```

/*:
 ## Where
 A switch case can use a where clause to check for additional conditions.
 */



/*:
 ## Compound Cases
 Multiple switch cases that share the same body can be combined by writing several patterns after case, with a comma between each of the patterns.
